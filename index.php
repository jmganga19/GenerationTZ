            <h2>Dear User</h2>
           <p> Some of us didn't further our education after secondary school.Some of us furthered to university.Some of us got married.Yes,some of us are not married.</p>
           <p>Some of us are still struggling with life;some of us are already settled.Some of us are still finding it difficult to eat two meals in a day.Some of us have travelled abroad.Some of us went back to the village.</p> 
           <p>Stop making your friends feel less valued because you are married,engageded or have multiple degrees.Life is full of ups and downs.Life can turn around.You can stretch your hand and be a blessing to your fellow classmates instead for mocking them simply because you are in a better position.</p>
           <p><strong>LIFE IS NOT PREDICTABLE,BE HUMBLE</strong></p>
